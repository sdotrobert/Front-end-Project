                        USD
                        if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.<br><br>

                        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its
                        suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages
                        whatsoever

                        and
                        even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.<br><br>

                        Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability
                        for
                        incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may
                        not
                        apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
                        permitted by law.<br><br>
